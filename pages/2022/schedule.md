# Plasma Hack Week 2021: Schedule

**Dates:** July 11th to July 15th <br>
**Times:** 11:00 am to 4:00 pm EDT

Each day of this year's **Plasma Hack Week** is focused around hacking,
so  come prepared to code and have fun!  While each day is centered
around hack, there will still be planned social time and lightning talks.
All pre-planned events will not exceed 5 hours in any given day, and we
highly encourage any breakout discussions and hack sessions that may be
inspired from the  day's activities.

This year's Hack Week will be held from July 11 to July 15.  The primary
goal of this year's event is to teach members of the Plasma community
the skills needed to contribute to open-source software and develop code
for the Plasma community as a whole.  The week will start off with
foundational topics and progress to more advanced topics as the week
proceeds.  The detailed schedule can be view [below](#the-schedule) and
the overview is as follows:

   Day 1 (foundational)
   : The first day focuses on how to set up your system in preparation
     for developing open-source Python software.

   Day 2 (foundational)
   : The second day is all about version control `git` and
     [GitHub](https://github.com/about).  These are the two primary
     tools used to collaboratively develop open-source software.

   Day 3 (intermediate)
   : In the third day we start developing our own open-source package,
     the [`hack`](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/hack-week) package.  To
     start the package we'll develop a plasma formulary using the
     `plasmapy.formulary` 
     ([pkg](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/tree/main/plasmapy/formulary) |
     [docs](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/formulary/index.html))
     as our guide.

   Day 4 & 5 (intermediate/advanced)
   : The last two days will focus on developing functionality participants
     are interested in, which can be suggested by any participant and/or
     select from pre-outlined 
     [project Issues](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/hack-week/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A2022).

Since this year's event is focused on hacking and learning by doing, it
is in its nature freeform.  So, feel free to bring up any topic you are
interested; ask any question you might have; and/or launch any breakout
discuss to explore your ideas.

## Lightning talks

A lightning talk is an informal 2-5 minute talk on any topic of interest
to Hack Week participants.  Example topics include a short demo of plasma
software, a hack week project idea, an upcoming event, a suggestion for
improving the culture of the plasma software community, something you
learned during the Hack Week, an upcoming event, or an idea for plasma
software that is yet to be developed.  The time allowed for each
lightning talk will depend on how many people sign up.  There may be
time during the Hack Week to request a lightning talk as well.
