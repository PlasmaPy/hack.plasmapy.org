Welcome to the second **Plasma Hack Week**!!  Our first event will be held 
remotely from June 28 - July 2, 2021.  The event is **free** and sets out to 
increase awareness of open-source software for the Plasma Community:
the benefits it can have on the community, what is currently available, and
how to foster community development of open-source software.  As such, topics will
range from demonstrating and using current open-source plasma software projects
to software engineering skills.  These topics will be presented through both
structured learning activities, such as guided tutorials, and unstructured project
time for collaborative learning.

<!--
In the week leading up to the **Plasma Hack Week**, a few more fundamentally
focused tutorials will be presented on topics like the basics of Python, using 
version control, contributing to open-source projects, etc.
